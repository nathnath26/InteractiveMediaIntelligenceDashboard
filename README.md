Description: 
I developed and deployed a full-stack, interactive media intelligence dashboard using Streamlit, powered by Google's Gemini AI. Hosted on GitHub, the web app allows users to upload datasets and receive real-time analysis, including sentiment classification, topic modeling, and dynamic visualizations. This project transforms static data analysis into an on-demand, AI-driven tool, demonstrating advanced skills in Python, API integration, and web application development.

Impact: 
This project's impact is an AI-powered tool that democratizes media intelligence. It empowers non-technical users to instantly analyze their own data, dramatically accelerating decision-making and replacing slow, manual reports with a scalable, on-demand solution.
